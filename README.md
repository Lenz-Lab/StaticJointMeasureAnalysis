# StaticJointMeasureAnalysis

Toolbox for conducting static joint measurements using statistical shape models.

## Description

This toolbox allows the user to calculate joint coverage, distance and congruence index witin a joint. This code is designed to be ran after a statsitical shape model has been performed on the population of interest. The code finds the distance and/or congruence index value at each correspondance particle across the population. This can be done on an individual or from calculated models from SSM, such as the overall mean shape.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* MATLAB R2020A or later

### Executing program

* Create a new folder in 'C:' drive called 'StaticJointMeasureAnalysis'
* Execute the matlab script 'Static_Joint_Measurement_Analysis.m'
* Change the "joint_names" variable to your joint name
* Change the "bone_names" variable to your two bone names
* Organize your folder with your models as described under the "Folder Architecture" heading
